            <h1>Credit Statement Parser</h1>
            <p>
                This tool attempts to parse credit statements from Community
                Banks of Colorado into a CSV with all transactions. It is
                heavily dependent on the PDF format, so will likely produce bad
                data if any format changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Further, the PDF provided by that bank is truly not designed for
                parsing. The "Notation" column will be copied into the
                description, and some credited amounts marked with "CR" are not
                properly detected, so the amounts in the generated CSV may not
                be negated as intended.
            </p>

            <p>
                The produced CSV will include a section which attempts to
                perform validation for any transactions, but manual review to
                ensure no transactions were missed is still recommended.
            </p>

            <p>
                All processing is done in your browser, no data is uploaded to
                any server.
            </p>
